== Tests ==

- QupZilla builds only with MSVC and QtWebEngine
It needs openssl library (I downloaded a precompiled version with msvc 2017)
Compile projects : src/lib/lib.pro, src/plugins/plugins.pro

- QtXlsxWriter builds with MinGW, and requires PERL.

- QGE has been compiled with mingw and MSVC 2017 (no dependencies)
